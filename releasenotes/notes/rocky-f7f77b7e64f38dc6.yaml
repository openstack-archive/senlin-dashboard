    [`bug/1777545 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/senlin-dashboard/+bug/1777545>`_]
    Fixed issue the deleted item is selected again with batch delete.
    Item selections on table view for batch actions are not cleared
    after execution of actions. To ensure to clear item selections,
    `hzTable:clearSelection` event is emitted.

    [`bug/1746706 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/senlin-dashboard/+bug/1746706>`_]
    Reproduced navigations when refreshing details view. Previously the fix
    for [`bug/1681627 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1681627>`_]
    allowed us to reload or directly open Angular-based detail page (ngdetail),
    but the navigation menu was not reproduced correctly.

    Fixed `type` for profile. Senlin API uses `type_name` for type, but
    dashboard did not process `type_name`. So this issue caused error to
    handle Profile object.

    [`bug/1754416 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/senlin-dashboard/+bug/1754416>`_]
    `region_name` was not passed on when using the senlin-dashboard.
    This makes the client always fallback on the first region. This issue was
    fixed.

    [`bug/1754183 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/senlin-dashboard/+bug/1754183>`_]
    Horizon by default sets the Project dashboard as default for non-admin
    users. The _50_senlin.py file that comes with the Senlin dashboard also
    has 'DEFAULT = True' set. Because 'cluster' comes before 'project'
    alphabetically, this defaults all non-admin users to getting the cluster
    dashboard on login. This issue was fixed.
