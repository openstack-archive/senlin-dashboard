    Angular-based panels are as default.
upgrade:
  - |
    Angular-based panels are as default. So ``_59_toggle_angular_senlin_dashboard.py``
    in ``openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.d/`` is not needed
    for enabling Angular-based panels. Conversely to use Django-based
    panels, operators need to use ``_59_toggle_angular_senlin_dashboard.py``
    and set ``False`` for each panels, e.g ``'profiles_panel': False,``.
deprecations:
  - |
    Angular-based panels are made as default. New features will not be
    added into Django-based panels anymore. And Django-based panels
    will be removed after S cycle or later.
